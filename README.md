### 1. Introduction

I designed this portfolio to introduce myself to the greater web development community. I am learning daily to develop my skills and I welcome any critisism or encouragement you would like to give. I believe through hard work and determination I can achieve the greatest of heights and look forward to walk the path life has before me.

### 2. Web Development Tools
   
   To design this portfolio I used mainly CSS with Mobile First in mind. In the coming weeks I will be coming up with a redesign of the page to better showcase my skills. Thank you for taking the time view my page.
