        <p>Hello there my name is Brent Graves. I graduated from the University of Alabama with Bachelors of Science degree in Biology. During my education I spent several years doing research in organic chemistry and genetics. This cultivated a love for learning and integrating new technologies into my work.</p>
        <br>
        <p> For the last 8 years I have managed overseeing the collection of 12 million dollars of accounts recievable overseeing 5 collectors at Wayne's Auto Sales in Birmingham, Alabama. I recently moved to Orlando, Florida. After 9 years at Waynes Auto Sales, I decided on a career change that would challenge my creativity and intellect. I enrolled in University of Central Florida's Coding Bootcamp. My life experience has prepared me for any challenges that I may face.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy biking, playing with my dogs and visiting the Disney parks. I believe I am a valueable asset to any team and am willing to go the extra mile in all my projects. Walt Disney once said of Disneyland, <em>“Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world.”</em> I take this same principle with all of my projects. They will never be truly completed but only to be perfected with every step of the way through hardwork, determination and innovation.</p>
